# Synthetic Event

* When a `DOM event` happens, for example, users types something into the input field. Now React intercepts that event and it will go tell React App something gets changed. 

* A `synthetic event` is kind of like a fake event that we pretend is a dumb event. It's not a actual `HTML`, but a `synthetic event` for example, `onChange` that we use to detect whenever that `DOM event` happens.
