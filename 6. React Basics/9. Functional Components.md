# Functional Components

* Functional components can be used when we only want to render some `HTML`. 

* Functional components don't have the access to `constructor()`, internal `state` and other lifeCycle functions.

* Functional component is just a component that gets some `props` and returns `HTML`

```Javascript
const component = () => {
    <div></div>
}
```
