# VirtualDOM

* React does not update the actual DOM tree but it instead creates its own virtualDOM in Javascript

* VirtualDOM is a complete copy of the actual DOM in Javascript

* If we have a new change, React will copy the virtual DOM again but with the new change. Then react will compare the new virtual DOM with the new DOM. React will now realize which node or element need to update, and that's the reason why react is so fast. `React is able to bacth multiple DOM updates together

* Make a copy of the old DOM -> Apply changes in the New DOM -> Compare the new DOM with the real DOM -> make the appropriate updates to exactly the right node

* data can be considered as `state`. React uses `states` to build out the `views`. If user did anything with the `views` that would trigger the `actions` and update the `state`. That's `unidirectional data flow`. It makes easier to track where the error is.
