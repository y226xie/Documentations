# Components in React

* Components in React is more like containers to contain certain UI elements. 

* Components usually take in `Props`, and `Props` is more like the parameter we get from our components. 

* `Props` is going to be an object of any properties that we write onto the component 

* One of the main properties that exists on this `props` object is one called `children`. The  `children` property will always be there but if there's no  `children` it will be `null`.

* `children` are actually what we pass in between the brackets of our component.

```Javascript
<MyComponent>
<h1> Some text </h1>
<MyComponent/>
```
Then in our `MyComponent` file, if we return 
``` JavaScript
export const MyComponent = props => {
    return <div>{props.children}</div>
}
```
We are able to see a `h1` tag, which contains `Some text` in the screen
