## Installation && Basic setting of a React project

NPX => runs a command of a package without installing it explicit 

It used to be `npm install -g create-react-app`. NPX allows us to not install this global version of `create-react-app` and just simply run that one command to create our app. 


### package.json

`react-scripts`: it allows us to don't worry about webpack and babel. It includes four scripts for us: 
    1. `react-scripts start` (start the project in localhost)
    2. `react-scripts build`(When this is called, all the react code in the src folder will turn into the older version of Javascript in order for browser to understand, and this older version of Javascript will be put it inside the public folder)
    3. `react-scripts test` (runs the test code we write)
    4. `react-scripts eject` (eject will take out all the configuration files that it's hidden from us )
