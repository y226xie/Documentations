# Includes() Function

* `Includes()` takes only a single arguement and that arguement will be any element that we want. And it will pass that element into our array and check to see if the elemt that we passed it exists in our array.

* The seconde argument we could pass in is the `index` in which we want to start searching

For example(primitive type): 
```javascript
const myArray = [1,2,3,4,5]
myArray.includes(3)
//Return true
myArray.includes(9)
//Return false
myArray.includes(2,3)
//Return false
myArray.includes(2,1)
//Return true
```
Second Example(object): 
```javascript
const newArray = [{id: 1}, {id: 2}, {id: 3}]
newArray.includes({id: 2})
//return false, because {id: 2} is an object and it has it's own reference

````

Side Notes:
* primitive types: `string`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `number`, `symbol`

```javascript
var a = 3
//It actually creates a new variable called a and it points to the three in the memory.
var b = a
//It actually points to the a, which points to the three in the memory
```
* whenever we see an object get instantiated for the first time or for any time, what we seen is the Javascript store that object as a reference 

```javascript
const obj1 = { id: 1}
const obj2 = { id: 1}
// This obj1 and obj2 both get a new reference in memory.
obj1 === obj2 
//return false. Javascript is comparing if the reference in the memory is the same. It's not comparing if the value of the obj1 and obj2 is equal to each other

const obj3 = obj2
obj3 === obj2
//return true

obj2.id = 17
//now if we do obj3.id, the value would also be 17
```
* If we change the property on the object, but they will always point to the same reference in memory.

In order to use `includes()` in the object, we need to do:

```javascript
const o1 = { id: 1}
const o2 = { id: 2}
const o3 = { id: 3}
const newArray = [o1, o2,o3]
newArray.includes(o1)
//this time it will return TRUE!
```
