# Filter() Function 

*  `filter()` is also a array method. It will also iterate through an array

* `filter()` will filter our the elements in our array based on the funtion that we pass it.

* `filter()` returns back a new array except it filters out the anything where the function condition returns `false`. Anything returns `true` will keep in the new array.

```javascript
 const myArray = [1,3,5,7,9]
 myArray.filter(el => el > 4)
 //We will get back [5,7,9]
 myArray.filter(el => true)
 //We will get back [1,3,5,7,9]
 myArray.filter(el => false)
 //We will get back []
```

We pass el as the arguement of our function and what we are going to return is actually a `true` or `false` value. So whatever the element get return `true` will get keep in our new array
