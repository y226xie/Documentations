# How to implement email functionality in project?

There are two main ways to implement it:
1. Use 3-rd party service
2. create your own service


## Using 3-rd party service

In this example, we will use Email.js as our 3-rd party service, and use React.js as our front-end.

### Overview
1. create your React.js front-end template
2. set up Email.js service
3. import Email.js in your code


For a quickly set up, we can implement the following code in App.js file.
Before that, let's install the reactstrap library first, so we can focus on the email functionality of the project

```
npm i -s reactstrap
```
